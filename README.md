# Procurement-Spend-Analysis
In this Power BI project, I conducted a thorough analysis of purchasing data by integrating diverse sources and calculating key metrics such as total purchase amount, quantity, and purchase order counts. Through dynamic visualizations like pie charts and trend graphs, I provided insights into buying package distribution and procurement trends.

#### Project Overview:

1. Total Purchase:
   - Display the overall sum of purchases made within the specified timeframe.

2. Total Quantity:
   - Showcase the total quantity of items purchased.

3. Total Purchase Orders (POs):
   - Highlight the total number of purchase orders generated.

4. Order Outers:
   - Present the count of outer packages ordered.

5. Received Outers:
   - Illustrate the number of outer packages actually received.

6. Total Final PO:
   - Demonstrate the total number of finalized purchase orders.

7. Total Non-Final PO:
   - Highlight the count of purchase orders that are not yet finalized.

#### Visualizations:

8. Pie Chart - Total Purchase by Buying Package:
   - Visual representation showing the distribution of purchases across different buying packages.

9. Bar and Line Graph - Total Purchase and Total PO:
   - Provide insights into the trend of total purchases and total purchase orders over time.

#### Data Analysis:

10.  Top 10 Items Ordered:
    - Table displaying information on the top 10 items ordered, including item name, quantity, and purchase amount.

11. Top 10 Supplier Information:
    - Table presenting details on the top 10 suppliers based on the total purchase amount.

#### Problem Statement:

12. Data Inconsistencies:
    - Identify and address any inconsistencies or discrepancies in the provided data.

13. Incomplete Purchase Orders:
    - Investigate and resolve issues related to purchase orders that are not finalized or missing information.

14. Outlier Detection:
    - Implement measures to identify and handle outliers in purchase quantities or amounts.

#### Solution Statement:

15. Data Cleaning and Validation:
    - Perform thorough data cleaning and validation to ensure accuracy and reliability.

16. Automated Finalization Process:
    - Develop an automated system for finalizing purchase orders, reducing manual errors and improving efficiency.

17.Outlier Handling Mechanism:
    - Implement a robust mechanism to handle outliers, ensuring that they are properly accounted for and do not distort analysis results.

#### How to Use:

18. Installation and Configuration:
    - Provide clear instructions on how to set up and configure the Power BI project for use.

19. Example Queries and Filters:
    - Include sample queries and filter settings to guide users in exploring the data effectively.

20. Documentation:
    - Comprehensive documentation explaining the data sources, transformations, and the interpretation of visualizations.
